## 1. Business context

- **Owner:** Sudheer Bellam, based in Hyderabad, India.
- **Business:** Civil engineering supplies and services — supplies construction materials (cement, TMT steel, bricks/blocks, aggregates, RMC, chemicals, tools, safety gear, surveying instruments) and offers services (material supply & delivery, site survey & estimation, bulk procurement, RMC pumping, equipment rental, technical consultation, project material planning).
- **Customers:** Builders, contractors, infrastructure firms, primarily in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh.
- **Primary website goals:**
  1. Let prospects submit **contact enquiries**.
  2. Let bulk buyers submit **RFQs (Request for Quote)** with BOQ file uploads.
  3. Showcase **products** (catalog with categories, no public pricing — quote-only).
  4. Showcase **services**.
  5. Give the owner an **admin panel** to read enquiries and quotes.

## 2. Tech stack (locked)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | **Angular 21** (standalone components, signals) + TypeScript (strict) + Angular Material + CSS (Flexbox/Grid) |
| Form handling | Angular `ReactiveFormsModule` with Material form fields |
| HTTP client | `HttpClient` + RxJS, centralized in `core/services/api.service.ts`, base URL from `environments/*` |
| Backend | **Spring Boot 4.1** (Java 25) + Spring MVC + Spring Data JPA / Hibernate |
| Database | **H2** (in-memory) for dev profile, **PostgreSQL 18** for prod — Flyway migrations |
| Auth | **JWT (HS256)** with access + refresh tokens, **RBAC** (`ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_STAFF`, `ROLE_VIEWER`) via Spring Security |
| Email | `JavaMailSender` over SMTP — works with Gmail app passwords, SendGrid, or AWS SES |
| File uploads | Local disk in dev (`./uploads`), **AWS S3** in production (via `StorageService` interface) |
| Rate limiting | Bucket4j on public endpoints (enquiries, quotes, newsletter) |
| Caching | Spring Cache (in-process) + Redis-ready |
| Deploy target | **AWS** — S3 + CloudFront for the Angular bundle (or Nginx container), ECS/Fargate or Elastic Beanstalk for the Spring Boot container, RDS PostgreSQL, SES, S3 for uploads |
| Containerization | Docker (multi-stage) + docker-compose for local; same images deploy to AWS |

**Do not introduce new frameworks** (no React, no Next.js, no Python web frameworks) unless the user explicitly asks.

## 3. Visual design

- Color palette: **navy blue (#0F2C5C)**, **white (#FFFFFF)**, **construction orange (#F58220)** as accent.
- Typography: Inter for body, Inter Display or Plus Jakarta Sans for headings.
- Style: clean, professional, trust-forward — not flashy. Construction/B2B feel.
- Always include: floating **WhatsApp button**, sticky mobile **"Get Quote"** CTA, GST number in footer.

## 4. Pages (frontend)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Hero, product categories, why-choose-us, services snippet, testimonials, CTA |

| `/products/[slug]` | Product detail page |
| `/services` | Services list with icons + CTA |
| `/about` | Company story, mission, certifications |
| `/contact` | Enquiry form → `POST /api/enquiries` + map embed + WhatsApp + phone |
| `/quote` | RFQ form with BOQ file upload → `POST /api/quotes` |
| `/admin` | Login → `POST /api/admin/login` |
| `/admin/dashboard` | Protected, lists enquiries + quotes, search/filter, mark status |

## 6. Database tables

- `enquiries` — already implemented in starter
- `quotes` (id, name, phone, email, project_details, site_location, boq_file_url, timeline, status, created_at)
- `categories` (id, name, slug, image_url, sort_order)
- `products` (id, name, slug, category_id FK, brand, unit, description, image_url, is_active, created_at)
- `admin_users` (id, email, password_hash, created_at)

Seed data: ~5 categories, ~15 products, 1 admin user.

## 8. Current state (when handoff starts)

The `backend/` folder already contains a working FastAPI starter with:
- `POST /api/enquiries` (validated, saves to DB, emails owner in background)
- `GET /api/enquiries` (temporary, **must be protected** with JWT in Phase 2)
- SQLite default, Postgres-ready via `DATABASE_URL`
- CORS for `localhost:3000`
- slowapi rate limiting
- `app/config.py`, `app/database.py`, `app/models.py`, `app/schemas.py`, `app/email_service.py`, `app/routers/enquiries.py`, `app/main.py`
- `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `README.md`

Everything else needs to be built.

---

## 9. Coding standards

- **Python:** type hints everywhere, Pydantic v2 syntax (`field_validator`, `model_config`), no `from typing import Optional` style — use `str | None`. Black-formatted.
- **TypeScript:** strict mode on, no `any`, prefer `type` over `interface` for unions, server components by default in Next.js App Router, mark `'use client'` only when needed.
- **Forms:** always react-hook-form + zod. Always show inline errors and a global success/error toast.
- **API client:** one `lib/api.ts` with a `fetcher()` that handles base URL, JSON, and errors. Don't sprinkle `fetch` everywhere.
- **Secrets:** never commit. `.env.example` only.
- **Commits:** conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).

---

## 10. Out of scope (do not build)

- Public-facing pricing or shopping cart (this is a quote-only B2B site)
- User accounts for customers (only one admin login)
- Payment integration
- Multi-language / i18n
- SEO blog / CMS (can be added later)
